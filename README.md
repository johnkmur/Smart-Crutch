# Smart-Crutch, a ThinkSlate Project

This is code for a Embedded Arduino, pressure sensor, and SD card that translate user's activity on a redesigned crutch that is meant to relieve pressure on the underarms. The crutch and program is the product of a team called ThinkSlate, a University of Michigan Club that combines majors across the campus to work on a new innovative product.


*This code is not yet completed and will have feature another program that complements this code by analyzing the SD card data.
